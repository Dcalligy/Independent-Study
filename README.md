# Independent-Study
My goal for this Independent Study is to create multiple Python scripts that use facial recognition libraries to study how facial recognition software works. The Facedetect.py detects faces with Python and OpenCV (and other Python libraries) using a webcam.
* Script detects user faces
* Labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and condisders the result as a binary number.
* The model used in this program is built and trains with faces via webcam and adds a tag on them, and later, the machine is given test data and the machine decides the correct label for the user.
